Biographer David Buckley writes that: 'Bowie was still reflecting the governing ideologies of the day and the dominant musical modes...rather than developing a distinct music of his own.'","Kevin Cann finds the musical ground on the album to encompass 'a fusion of acoustic folk leanings with a growing interest in electric rock'. Cann continues that David Bowie marked a turning point for the artist, in that lyrically he began 'drawing on life' rather than writing 'winsome stories'.","Spitz considers the album to be Bowie's first 'heavy' record and also one of his darkest, due to the death of his father. He writes that it reflects the artist's 'darkening vision' and depicts 'a man coming of age in a world that is increasingly depraved and barren'.","Susie Goldring of BBC Music calls David Bowie a 'kaleidoscopic album [that] is an amalgamation of [Bowie's] obsessions – directors, musicians, poets and spirituality of a distinctly late-60s hue'."],"releaseMonth":"November","releaseYear":1969,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/87c04e331399cf84e4fa098fa9c7c564.jpg","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie_(1969_album)"},{"title":"The Man Who Sold the World","filename":"manwhosoldtheworld.txt","songs":["The Width of a Circle","All the Madmen","Black Country Rock","After All","Running Gun Blues","Saviour Machine","She Shook Me Cold","The Man Who Sold the World","The Supermen"],"background":["The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by David Bowie. It was originally released on Mercury Records in November 1970 in the United States and in April 1971 in the UK. The album was Bowie's first with the nucleus of what would become the \"Spiders from Mars\", the backing band made famous by The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars in 1972. Though author David Buckley has described the singer's previous record David Bowie (Space Oddity) as \"the first Bowie album proper\", NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray have said of The Man Who Sold the World, \"this is where the story really starts\". It has been claimed that this album's release marks the birth of glam rock.\n\nCorrect track listing:\n1. Width of a Circle - 8:09\n2. All the Madmen - 5:41\n3. Black Country Rock - 3:36\n4.

The follow-up to his breakthrough The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, it was the first album Bowie wrote and released as a bona fide rock star. While many critics agree that it contains some of his best material, opinion as to its overall quality has often been divided. NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray called the album \"oddly unsatisfying, considerably less than the sum of the parts\", while Bowie encyclopedist Nicholas Pegg describes it as \"one of the most urgent, compelling and essential\" of his releases. The Rolling Stone review by Ben Gerson pronounced it \"less manic than The Man Who Sold The World, and less intimate than Hunky Dory, with none of its attacks of self-doubt.\" It was one of six Bowie entries in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time (at #277) and ranked #77 on Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1970s."],"releaseMonth":"April","releaseYear":1973,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/44e400c8a87c94e62a6376d7e53ef764.png","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie_(1969_album)"},{"title":"Diamond Dogs","filename":"diamondogs.txt","songs":["Future Legend","Diamond Dogs","Sweet Thing","Candidate","Sweet Thing (reprise)","Rebel Rebel","Rock 'n' Roll With Me","We Are the Dead","1984","Big Brother","Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family"],"background":["Diamond Dogs is the eighth album by David Bowie, originally released in 1974 on RCA Records.\n\nThematically, it was a marriage of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell and Bowie's own glam-tinged vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Bowie had wanted to make a theatrical production of Orwell's book and began writing material after completing sessions for his 1973 album Pin Ups, but the author’s estate denied the rights. The songs ended up on the second half of Diamond Dogs instead where, as the titles indicated, the Nineteen Eighty-Four theme was prominent.\n\nThough the album was recorded and released after the 'retirement' of Ziggy Stardust in mid-1973, and featured its own lead character in Halloween Jack (\"a real cool cat\" who lives in the decaying \"Hunger City\"), Ziggy was seen to be still very much alive in Diamond Dogs, as evident from Bowie's haircut on the cover and the glam-trash style of the first single \"Rebel Rebel\".\n\nDavid Bowie - vocals, guitars, saxes, Moog synthesizer, Mellotron,

The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", and the cover featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and recalls almost nothing of the production.\n\nMusically, \"Station to Station\" was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, \"Young Americans\", while presenting a new direction towards synthesizers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as \"Kraftwerk\" and \"Neu!\". This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\", recorded with Brian Eno in 1977–79. Bowie himself has said that \"Station to Station\" was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\". The album’s lyrics, meanwhile, reflected his preoccupations with Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion.\n\nWith its blend of funk and Krautrock, romantic balladry and occultism, \"Station to Station\" has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\". Featuring the single \"Golden Years\", it made the Top 5 in both the UK and US charts. In 2003, the album was ranked number 323 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."],"releaseMonth":"January","releaseYear":1976,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/6d5e3ba9f875ec614950bb54f7cf9655.png","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_to_Station"}],"mood":"","sytle":"","start":1974,"end":1976,"image":"duke.svg","className":"","analysis":{"word_count":5591,"processed_language":"en","personality":[{"trait_id":"big5_openness","name":"Openness","category":"personality","percentile":0.40038696046489064,"raw_score":0.7405951764483646,"significant":true,"children":[{"trait_id":"facet_adventurousness","name":"Adventurousness","category":"personality","percentile":0.7419583427993159,"raw_score":0.5279140728018563,"significant":true},{"trait_id":"facet_artistic_interests","name":"Artistic

The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on \"Heroes\" and Lodger. The album's working title was New Music Night and Day.\n\nThe genesis of Low lies in both the foundations laid by Bowie's previous album Station to Station, and music he intended for the soundtrack to The Man Who Fell to Earth. When Bowie presented his material for the film to Nicolas Roeg, the director decided that it would not be suitable. Roeg preferred a more folksy sound, although John Phillips (the chosen composer for the soundtrack) described Bowie's contributions as \"haunting and beautiful\". Elements from these pieces were incorporated into Low instead. The album's cover, like Station to Station, is a still from the movie: the photographic image, under the album's title, formed a deliberate pun on the phrase \"low profile\".\n\nDavid Bowie – vocals (2-6, 8, 10-12, 14), saxophones (4, 11), guitar (6, 9-11), pump bass (6), harmonica (7), vibraphone (9-10), xylophone (10), pre-arranged percussion (10), keyboards: ARP synthesiser (1, 10), Chamberlin: Credited on the album sleeve notes as \"tape horn and brass\" (1), \"synthetic strings\" (1, 4, 9-10), \"tape cellos\" (5) and \"tape sax section\" (7), piano (7, 9-11), \"instruments\" (13)\nBrian Eno – keyboards: splinter Minimoog (2), report ARP (3), rimmer E.M.I.

The album is considered one of his best by critics, notably for the contributions of guitarist Robert Fripp who flew in from the U.S. to record his parts in one day.

The title track of the album became one of Bowie’s biggest hit singles, reaching number 1 in the UK, the US and various other countries. Further singles included “Modern Love” and “China Girl”, which both reached number 2 in the UK. “China Girl” was a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the latter’s 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a rerecorded version of the song “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” which had been a minor hit for Bowie a year earlier. Let’s Dance is also notable as a stepping stone for the career of the Texas blues guitar virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on it. The album was also released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let’s Dance has sold over 10 and a half million copies worldwide, making it Bowie’s best-selling album.\n\nSongs and album development:\nBowie, having just signed with EMI records for a reported $17.5m, worked with Nile Rodgers to release a “commercially buoyant” new album that was described as “original party-funk cum big bass drum sound greater than the sum of its influences.” The album’s influences were described as Louis Jordan, the Asbury Jukes horn section, Bill Doggett, Earl Bostic and James Brown.  Bowie spent a mere three days making demos for the album in New York before cutting the album, a rarity for Bowie who, for the previous few albums, usually showed up with little more than “a few ideas.” Despite this, the album “was recorded, start to finish, including mixing, in 17 days” according to Rodgers.\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan, who met Bowie at the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival, when discussing the album, said “to tell you the truth, I was not very familiar with David’s music when he asked me to play on the sessions. … David and I talked for hours and hours about our music, about funky Texas blues and its roots – I was amazed at how interested he was. At Montreux, he said something about being in touch and then tracked me down in California, months and months later.”\n\nUnusually, Bowie played no instruments on the album. “I don’t play a damned thing. This was a singer’s album.”\n\nA few years later, Bowie discussed his feelings on the track “Ricochet” (which Musician magazine called an “incendiary ballroom raveup”) from this album:\n\n“I thought it was a great song, and the beat wasn’t quite right. It didn’t roll the way it should have, the syncopation was wrong. It had an ungainly gait; it should have flowed. … Nile  did his own thing to it, but it wasn’t quite what I’d had in mind when I wrote the thing.”\n\nThe album was generally positively reviewed by critics and well received by fans, with at least one reviewer calling it “Bowie at his best.”\n\nThe success of the album surprised Bowie. In 1997, he said “at the time, Let’s Dance was not mainstream. It was virtually a new kind of hybrid, using blues-rock guitar against a dance format. There wasn’t anything else that really quite sounded like that at the time. So it only seems commercial in hindsight because it sold so many . It was great in its way, but it put me in a real corner in that it fucked with my integrity.”\n\nIn fact, Bowie would later state that the success of the album caused him to hit a creative low-point in his career which lasted the next few years. “I remember looking out over these waves of people  and thinking, ‘I wonder how many Velvet Underground albums these people have in their record collections?’ I suddenly felt very apart from my audience. And it was depressing, because I didn’t know what they wanted.”\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by David Bowie except as noted.\n\nSide one:\nA1 “Modern Love” – 4:46\nA2 “China Girl” (Bowie, Iggy Pop) – 5:32\nA3 “Let’s Dance” – 7:38\nA4 “Without You” – 3:08\n\nSide two\nB1 “Ricochet” – 5:14\nB2 “Criminal World” (Peter Godwin, Duncan Browne, Sean Lyons) – 4:25\nB3 “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” (lyrics: Bowie, music: Giorgio Moroder) – 5:09\nB4 “Shake It” – 3:49"],"releaseMonth":"March","releaseYear":1983,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/12cd5ebef24922cd8110c609045c2cd0.jpg","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Dance_(David_Bowie_album)"},{"title":"Tonight","filename":"tonight.txt","songs":["Loving the Alien","Don't Look Down","God Only Knows","Tonight","Neighborhood Threat","Blue Jean","Tumble and Twirl","I Keep Forgetting","Dancing with the Big Boys"],"background":["Tonight is the sixteenth studio album by David Bowie, released in 1984.\n\nDavid Bowie worked on Tonight after finishing up his Serious Moonlight Tour in support his previous album Let's Dance.

Bowie conceived the album as the foundation for a theatrical world tour, writing and recording most of the songs in Switzerland. He considered the record a return to rock 'n' roll music. Three singles were released from the album, \"Day-In Day-Out\", \"Time Will Crawl\" and \"Never Let Me Down\", the first two of which were top 10 hits around the world.\n\nOne of Bowie's better-selling albums to date, Never Let Me Down was certified Gold by the RIAA in early July 1987, less than three months after its release date, and charted in the top 10 in several European countries, although it only reached number 34 on the US charts. Despite its commercial success, this album was poorly received by fans and critics, who often regard the mid-to-late 1980s as a low point of creativity and musical integrity for Bowie. Bowie later distanced himself from the album, but admitted a fondness for many of the songs and eventually remixed the track \"Time Will Crawl\" (one of his all-time favourites) for inclusion on his career retrospective release, iSelect (2008).\n\nIn support of this album, Bowie embarked on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that was at that point the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound","Vision Tour.

The album was Bowie's reunion with Brian Eno, whom Bowie had worked with most famously on his Berlin Trilogy in the 1970s.  Subtitled \"the Ritual Art-Murder of Baby Grace Blue: A non-Linear Gothic Drama Hyper-Cycle,\" Outside centers on the characters of a dystopian world on the eve of the 21st century.\n\nThe liner notes feature a short story by Bowie, the Diary of Nathan Adler, which outlines a somewhat dystopian version of the year 1999 in which the government, through its arts commission, had created a new bureau to investigate the phenomenon of Art Crime. In this future, murder and mutilation of bodies had become a new underground art craze. The main character, Nathan Adler, was in the business of deciding what of this was legally acceptable as art and what was, in a word, trash. The album is filled with references to characters and their lives as he investigates the complicated events leading up to the murder of a fourteen-year-old girl. One is meant to assume that Bowie's character, Nathan Adler, works for the British government due to several references to the cities of London and Oxford, but in the liner notes these are revealed to be, at least in some cases, London, Ontario and Oxford, New Jersey, indicating that the entire story may take place in North America—or, indeed, that the distinction between the two places has become blurred and indistinguishable.\n\nBowie had considered writing an album every year or so through the end of the millennium to tell the story of how the end of the millennium felt.  He said, \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, by a narrative device, to chronicle the final five years of the millennium. The over-ambitious intention is to carry this through to the year 2000.\"  He felt he had recorded enough material during the Outside sessions that he voiced his intention to continue the narrative of Outside through a 3-album set.  He intended to call the second follow-up album \"Contamination,\" and had sketched out the characters for the album (including some \"17th century people\") and had expected the album to be released in the spring of '97.  Despite this, no direct follow-up to the album was ever produced, and Bowie's next album was his jungle and drum and bass-influenced work Earthling."],"releaseMonth":"September","releaseYear":1995,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/007761d122d75d12c03305238399cab5.png","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_(David_Bowie_album)"},{"title":"Earthling","filename":"earhling.txt","songs":["Little Wonder","Looking for Satellites","Battle for Britain (The Letter)","Seven Years in Tibet","Dead Man Walking","Telling Lies","The Last Thing You Should Do","I'm Afraid of Americans","Law (Earthlings on Fire)"],"background":["Earthling (stylised as EART HL I NG) is the 20th studio album by English recording artist David Bowie.

Worldwide, it sold over two million copies and experienced a four-month run on the UK charts. Although its production had started before September 11 attacks in 2001, the album was finished after that date, which resulted in the influencing of its concept.\n\nHeathen marked the return of record producer Tony Visconti, who co-produced (with David Bowie himself) several of Bowie's classic albums. The last album Visconti had co-produced was Scary Monsters in 1980.  Originally, Bowie had recorded the album Toy for release in 2000 or '01. This album was meant to feature some new songs and remakes of some his lesser-known songs from the 1960s. Although Toy remains officially unreleased, a few of its tracks—including \"Afraid\" and \"Slip Away\" (then titled \"Uncle Floyd\")—appear on Heathen. Some other re-recorded songs were included as B-sides to the singles from Heathen.\n\nThe album features guest appearances from The Who guitarist Pete Townshend (who had played guitar on an earlier Bowie track, \"Because You're Young\" from Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)), Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess, pianist Kristeen Young, and prolific bassist Tony Levin of King Crimson. The song \"I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spacecraft\" contains the lowest note Bowie has ever sung on an album (G1).\n\nDavid Bowie – vocals, keyboards, guitars, saxophone, stylophone, backing vocals, drums\nTony Visconti – bass guitar, guitars, recorders, string arrangements, backing vocals\nMatt Chamberlain – drums, drum loop programming, percussion\nDavid Torn – guitars, guitar loops, Omnichord"],"releaseMonth":"June","releaseYear":2002,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/de189195ab834c449adfc34815549796.png","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathen_(David_Bowie_album)"},{"title":"Reality","filename":"reality.txt","songs":["New Killer Star","Pablo Picasso","Never Get Old","The Loneliest Guy","Looking for Water","She'll Drive the Big Car","Days","Fall Dog Bombs The Moon","Try Some, Buy Some","Reality","Bring Me The Disco King"],"background":["Reality is an album by the British singer-songwriter David Bowie, released in 2003. The album was well received by fans and critics and was one of Bowie's most critically acclaimed albums since Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), alongside Heathen. It was his latest album for ten years, until the release of The Next Day in 2013.\n\nSome of the lyrics found in Reality deal with Bowie's perception of himself as an old person, as in the songs \"The Loneliest Guy\", \"Days\", the ironic \"Never Get Old\", and especially on the nostalgic \"Bring Me The Disco King\". The album also makes reference to the 9/11 attacks in \"New Killer Star\" and the concept of Reality as subjective.\n\nOver the promotional period, the album was released in a variety of formats. The standard release was a single jewel case CD version, followed by the CD with a three track bonus CD in digipak format. The album was then released as a multichannel hybrid SACD, and then reissued with a bonus live DVD recorded in London.\n\n Track listing\n\nAll songs written by David Bowie except where noted.\n\n

The album was announced on January 8th, 2013, Bowie's sixty-sixth birthday.\n\nIt is Bowie's first album of new material in ten years, since 2003's Reality, and surprised fans and media who believed he had retired.  The Next Day Extra, an additional disc featuring four more tracks, and remixes of songs from the original album, was released eight months later in November.  The Next Day was met with critical acclaim, and earned Bowie his first number-one album in the UK since 1993's Black Tie White Noise.\n\nThe cover art for the album is an adapted version of Bowie's 1977 album, \"Heroes\".  Designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, who also designed packaging for Heathen and Reality, the obscuring of the photograph connotes \"forgetting or obliterating the past\".  Barnbrook explained the cover, saying: \"If you are going to subvert an album by David Bowie there are many to choose from but this is one of his most revered, it had to be an image that would really jar if it were subverted in some way and we thought \"Heroes\" worked best on all counts.\""],"releaseMonth":"March","releaseYear":2013,"cover":"https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/06771953f5d241f3dc24eecd016f381a.png","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Day"},{"title":"Blackstar","filename":"blackstar.txt","songs":["Blackstar","'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore","Lazarus","Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)","Girl Loves Me","Dollar Days","I Can't Give Everything Away"],"background":["Blackstar (stylised as ★) is the 25th studio album by David Bowie, released on January 8, 2016, the date of Bowie's 69th birthday. The album features seven songs, with the title track being released as a single on November 20, 2015. \n\nBowie died on January 10, 2016 after a secret 18 month battle with cancer: it was 2 days after his 69th birthday and the release of Blackstar (2016). Tony Visconti - a producer and friend with Bowie for over 5 decades - commented \"He made Blackstar for us — his parting gift . I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn’t, however, prepared for it.\"\n\nThe album artwork was revealed through a video posted on Facebook on 18 November 2015, and a music video for the title track was released on Bowie's YouTube channel the following day. The song was later made available for purchase through the iTunes Store, as well as a pre-order for the entire album. The title track is being used as the opening music for the television series The Last Panthers. \n\nThe album was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, accumulating a Metacritic score of 86 and reaching #1 on the charts in many countries in its first week of release. It was Bowie's first #1 album in the U.S.\n\nGrammy Award (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Bowie took the award for \"Best Rock Song\" for
