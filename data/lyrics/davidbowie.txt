God Knows I'm Good

[Verse 1]
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

[Chorus]
Crying God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

[Verse 2]
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

[Chorus]
Crying God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey!


An Occasional Dream

[Verse 1]
I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

[Chorus]
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

[Verse 2]
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

[Chorus]
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine


Janine

[Verse 1]
Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

[Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

[Verse 2]
You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

[Pre-Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

[Chorus]
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all


Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

[Verse 1]
Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to
You won't be the first or last

[Verse 2]
It must strain you to look down
So far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me
In his house could do for you

[Verse 3]
I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

[Verse 4]
I'm a Phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye socket's empty
See nothing but pain
I keep havin' this brainstorm
About twelve times a day

[Chorus]
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me
Quite amazed
As I am unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 5]
I've got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream

[Chorus]
So now you could spend your morning talking with me
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

[Verse 6]
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching

[Chorus]
So now, you should spend the morning, lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
I'm not following

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down


Memory of a Free Festival

[Intro]
"Maybe I should announce it, should I?
Memory of a free festival."

[Verse 1]
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

[Verse 2]
Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

[Verse 3]
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same

[Verse 4]
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

[Outro]
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party


Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud

[Verse 1]
Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

[Verse 2]
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh, "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

[Verse 3]
It's really me
Really you and really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you and really Me
You'll lose me, though I'm always
Really free

[Verse 4]
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud

[Verse 5]
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

[Verse 6]
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track


Cygnet Committee

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 1]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart
To ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me

[Chorus 1]
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

[Verse 2]
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
"Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

[Bridge]
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

[Outro]
Live
Live
Live


Letter to Hermione

[Verse 1]
The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So, rest your head and
Read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not quite sure what
We're supposed to do
So, I've been writing just for you

[Verse 2]
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark, well so do I

[Chorus 2]
I'm not quite sure
What you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

[Verse 3]
He makes you laugh, he brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?

[Chorus 3]
I'm not quite sure what
I'm supposed to do
So, I'll just write some love to you
Do, do, do, do


Space Oddity

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Outro]
