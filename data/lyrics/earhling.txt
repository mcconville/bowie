Seven Years in Tibet

[Verse 1]
"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains,"
The old woman said

So I drink in the shadows of an evening sky
See nothing at all

[Verse 2]
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone

Time to question the mountain: Why pigs can fly?
It's nothing at all

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away

[Outro]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing


The Last Thing You Should Do

[Verse 1]
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do-oh-oh-oh-oh

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

[Verse 1]
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
What have you been doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do-oh-oh-oh-oh


Dead Man Walking

[Verse 1]
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
Now I'm older than movies
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance away
[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
Now I'm wiser than dreams
[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me fly, fly, fly
[Spin slack through reality]
While I'm touching tomorrow
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
And I know who's there
[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
[Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone]
When silhouettes fall
[Spinning slack through reality]

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

[Verse 2]
Three old men dancing under her lamp lights
Shaking their sex in the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked, anew
Like a bad tempered child
On the rain slicked streets

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
Now I'm older than movies
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance away
[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
Now I'm wiser than dreams
[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me fly, fly, fly
[Spin slack through reality]
While I'm touching tomorrow
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
And I know who's there
[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
[Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone]
When silhouettes fall
[Spinning slack through reality]

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance, dance, dance
[Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly]
And I'm gone
[Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone]
Let me dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man


I'm Afraid of Americans

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in America,
Lo-Teks at the wheel
No one needs anyone
They don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it

I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny wants a plane
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
Johnny's in America

I'm afraid I can't help it

I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't

I'm afraid I can't
Yeah, I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

[Outro]
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American
God is an American

Little Wonder

[Verse 1]
Stinky weather, fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, grumpy gnomes

Telling Lies

[Intro]
Telling lies

[Verse 1]
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time

Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies

[Chorus]
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)

Telling lies

[Verse 2]
Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure

Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future, I am tomorrow, I am the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies
Telling lies

[Chorus]
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)
Telling lies (Oh ah visionary, oh ah visionary)
Telling lies (feels like somethings going to happen this year)

Telling lies

Telling lies

[Outro]
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Oh ah oh
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
(Telllliiing lllliiiies)
Oh ah
Feels like somethings going to happen this year
