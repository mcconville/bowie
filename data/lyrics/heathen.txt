Cactus

[Verse 1]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

[Verse 2]
I miss your kissing and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

[Verse 3]
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

[Interlude]
D-A-V-I-D

[Verse 3]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

[Outro]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore


Sunday

[Intro]
Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes

[Verse]
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(In your fear)
In your fear
(Seek only peace)
Of what we have become
(In your fear, seek only love)
Take to the fire
(In your fear)
Now we must burn
(Seek only peace)
All that we are
(In your fear, seek only love)
Rise together
(In your fear)
Through these clouds
(In your fear)
As on wings

This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials
Lord, will be remembered

[Outro]
Everything has changed


5:15 the Angels Have Gone

[Verse 1]
5:15
I'm changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down

[Verse 2]
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing towns

[Chorus 1]
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you

[Verse 3]
5:15
All of my life
Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Strange sandy eyes

[Verse 4]
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone

[Chorus 2]
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever I'm out of here forever

I Would Be Your Slave

[Verse 1]
Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

[Chorus]
I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

[Verse 2]
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

[Chorus]
I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave


I've Been Waiting for You

[Intro]
I've been looking, I've been looking
I've been looking, I've been looking

[Verse 1]
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me

[Chorus]
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

[Verse 2]
A woman with a feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me

[Chorus]
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now


Afraid

[Verse 1]
I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown

[Chorus]
And I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid
On my own
On my own

[Verse 2]
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

[Chorus]
And I won't feel afraid
No I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid anymore


[Outro]
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)
Anymore
(And then I just won't be afraid)


A Better Future

[Verse 1]
Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all the sorrow

[Chorus]
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smiles

[Verse 2]
Give them moon and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

[Bridge]
When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall

[Verse 3]
Down there below
Nothing is moving
I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future

[Chorus]
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future

[Outro]
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you
I demand a better future


Slip Away

[Verse 1]
Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones
To see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they slip away

[Verse 2]
Once a time
They nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

[Chorus]
Don't forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o

[Verse 3]
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

[Chorus]
Don't forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o

[Outro]
Sailing


Everyone Says Hi

[Verse 1]
Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say

[Verse 2]
Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'

[Verse 3]
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say

[Verse 4]
I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says 'hi'

[Bridge]
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it
We could do it

Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are

[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says 'hi'
And your mum and dad
Everyone says 'hi'
And your big fat dog
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Hi hi hi hi


Heathen

[Verse 1: David Bowie]
The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the sky
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With heat rising through my eyes
Every day, your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, hey, yeah

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
Oh, when I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
They broke the heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Verse 3: David Bowie]
Oh, people on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts are beatin'
Like pendulums swingin' on a chain
When you think you lost everything
You find out you can lose a little more
I, I'm just going down the, that road feeling bad
Tryin' hard to get to Heaven before they close the door

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Bridge: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door

[Verse 4: David Bowie]
I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be alright
But I don't know what alright even means
I close my eyes and I wonder, boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I've been to Sugar Town, oh, shook the sugar down
Tryin' to get to Heaven before they close the door, hey

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey, David Bowie]
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get there)
Before they close the door (Woo, door)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven (Tryin' to get to Heaven)
Before they close the door (And relive my dreams there)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door (I've been all around the world, boys)
Ooh, tryin' to get to Heaven
Before they close the door


Slow Burn

[Verse 1]
Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
Shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in their dark
And they'll play with our lives

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
Hark who are we
So small in times such as these

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

[Verse 2]
Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows?
Though the years spare them all

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round
And upside down
There's fear overhead
There's fear overground

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

[Chorus]
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round And here are we
At the center of it all

[Refrain]
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
