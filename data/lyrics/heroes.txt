Sons of the Silent Age

[Verse 1]
Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in the back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimension
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)

[Verse 2]
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
They pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

[Chorus]
Baby, I will never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)

[Outro]
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound) Baby, baby, baby
Find another way


The Secret Life of Arabia

[Chorus]
The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen

[Verse 1]
I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades

[Chorus]
Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia

[Verse 2]
You must see the movie, the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

[Chorus]
Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen

Blackout

[Verse 1]
Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

[Verse 2]
Get me to the doctor's, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence and my honour’s at stake
The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

[Verse 3]
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
(Kiss you in the rain) Kiss you in the rain (Kiss you in the rain)
In the rain (In the rain)

[Bridge]
Get me to the doctor

[Outro]
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)


'Heroes'

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

[Bridge]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

Joe the Lion

[Chorus]
Joe the lion went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

[Verse 1]
Boy, thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off
Boy, thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep
You can buy God
It's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

[Chorus]
Joe the lion went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was a fortune teller
He said, "nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"
Joe the lion, yeah, yeah
Went to the bar, yeah, yeah
A couple of dreams and he was a fortune teller
He said, "nail me to my car, tell you who you are"

[Verse 2]
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your cheek
The day laughs in your face
I guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
And you'll get up and sleep

[Outro]
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion, made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Made of iron


Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 1]
Weaving down a byroad
Singing the song
That's my kind of highroad
Gone wrong

[Chorus]
My-my, smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 2]
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?

[Chorus]
My-my, someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Bridge]
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should, my-my

[Verse 3]
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God heaven left us
Standing on our feet

[Chorus]
My-my, Beauty and the Beast, my-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling
My-my, my-my


Sense of Doubt
