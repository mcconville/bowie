Shake It

[Intro]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me?

[Verse 2]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

[Verse 3]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Sitting on a flagstone, talking to a faceless girl
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Been wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
'Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'd fight for you
You're better than money

[Verse 3]
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
When I'm feeling disconnected, well, I sure know what to do
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Oh, shake it, shake it

[Pre-Chorus]
I duck and I sway (what's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (what's my line?)
So what's my line?

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it (whoa!)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)

[Outro]
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)


Ricochet

[Verse 1]
Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
"And who can bear to be forgotten"
"And who can bear to be forgotten"

[Chorus]
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
"Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that."
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
"And who can bear to be forgotten"
"And who can bear to be forgotten"

[Chorus]
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
"Early, before the sun
They struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unraveling before them"
March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

[Verse 3]
"That's when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten"


Without You

[Verse 1]
Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do?

[Verse 2]
And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

[Chorus]
There's no smoke without fire
Woman, I love you
Without you
What would I do?


Criminal World

[Verse 1]
You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that is at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary, this is no ordinary

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

[Verse 2]
You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary, I am no ordinary

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-faced

[Outro]
What a criminal world
What a criminal...
Criminal
What a criminal world
What a criminal...
Criminal


Modern Love

[Intro]
I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done

[Verse 1]
I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Verse 2]
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love

[Verse 3]
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on time) terrifies me
(Church on time) makes me party
(Church on time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)


China Girl

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Verse 1]
I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

[Verse 2]
I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the mornings, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

[Chorus 1]
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

[Verse 3]
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

[Bridge]
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says... shh
She says...

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says...

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl


Let's Dance

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 1]
(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

[Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 2]
(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) you could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Chorus]
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 3]
(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Guitar solo]

(Let's...)
(Let's...)
(Let's...)
(Let's sway)

Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
