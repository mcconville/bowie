Repetition

[Verse 1]
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevyâ€™s real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

[Chorus]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Verse 2]
And the food is on the table but the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

[Chorus]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Outro]
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through


Red Sails

[Verse 1]
I feel a little roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action, wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

[Refrain]
Thunder ocean, thunder ocean
Red sails take me, make me sail along
Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails, red sails

[Verse 2]
Do you remember, we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall keep us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

[Refrain]
Red sails, thunder ocean
Red sails, sailor can't dance like you
Red sail, red sail action
Red sail, some reaction

[Verse 3]
Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along

[Outro]
Life stands still and stares
The hinterland, the hinterland
We're going to sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da
1, 2, 3, 4
Oooooooh


African Night Flight

[Verse 1]
African night flight one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Got to get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well
Seemed like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

[Chorus]
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days

[Cricket Menace]

[Verse 2]
Getting in the mood for a Mombasa night flight
Pushing my luck, going to fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff, skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber, less than peace
Struggle with a child, whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

[Chorus]
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days

[Refrain]

Red Money

[Verse 1]
Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?
Like a nervous disease (And it's been there all along)
It will tumble from the sky (And it's been there all along)

[Chorus]
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?

[Verse 2]
I was really feeling good
Reet Petite and how'd you do
Then I got the small red box
And I didn't know what to do
'Cause my fingers could not grope
And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it, stop it, take it away

[Chorus]
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?
Project cancelled
Tumbling central
Red money
Can you hear it fall?
Can you hear it well?
Can you hear it at all?
Can you hear it at all?
Can you hear it at all?

[Outro]
Red money
Red money
Red money
Red money
Such responsibility
It's up to you and me


Fantastic Voyage

[Verse 1]
In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion
And we never get old

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Remember it's true
Dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

[Chorus]
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's a very modern world
But nobody's perfect
It's a moving world
But that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again
Will we?

[Verse 2]
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Remember it's true
Loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

[Chorus]
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

[Post-Chorus 2]
But any sudden movement
I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated
But I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again
How can I?


Move On

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the need to move on
So I pack a bag and move on
Move on
Well, I might take a train or sail at dawn
Might take a girl when I move on
When I move on

[Verse 2]
Somewhere, someone is calling me
When the chips are down
I am just a travelling man
Maybe it is just a trick of the mind
But somewhere there is a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

[Verse 3]
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

[Bridge]
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo

[Verse 4]
Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you

[Outro]
I can't forget you, can't forget you


Look Back in Anger

[Verse 1]
"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
'Til you come

[Verse 2]
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
'Til you come

[Outro]
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long)


D.J.

[Verse 1]
I am home, lost my job
And incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, turn around no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers
Believing in me

[Verse 2]
One more weekend
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers
Believing me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no (kiss-kiss)

[Verse 3]
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

[Outro]
I've got believers, I've got believers
I've got believers in me (I've got believers)
I am a D.J., I am what I play, I am a D.J


Boys Keep Swinging

[Verse 1]
Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry when you're a boy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you're a boy, you can wear a uniform
When you're a boy, other boys check you out
You get a girl, these are your favorite things
When you're a boy

[Chorus]
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

[Verse 2]
Uncage the colors, unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone you, you are always first on the line
When you're a boy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're a boy, you can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy, learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

[Chorus]
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
