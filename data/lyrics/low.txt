Always Crashing in the Same Car

[Verse 1]
Every chance, every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

[Verse 2]
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car
Yeah, yeah


What in the World

[Verse 1]
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do?
What in the world can you do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do?
What in the world can I do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

[Outro]
Oh, what you going to say?
Oh, what you going to do?
Ah, what you going to be?
To the real me
To the real me


Sound and Vision

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse]
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?


A New Career in a New Town

Subterraneans

[Verse]
Share bride failing star
Care-line, care-line
Care-line, care-line riding me
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, own
Share bride failing star


Breaking Glass

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen

[Verse 2]
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See

[Bridge]
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you


Be My Wife

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Outro]
Sometimes you get so lonely
