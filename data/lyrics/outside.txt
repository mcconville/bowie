Segue - Ramona A. Stone

[Verse 1]
I was
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a MIDI-life crisis
And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are

[Bridge]
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

[Verse 2]
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say: twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female
Good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
(And she should say)
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

[Verse 3]
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name

[Bridge]
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone[x2]

[Outro]
(Give it to me one more time!)
Anxiety descending[x2]


Thru' These Architects Eyes

[Intro]
(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Verse 1]
Stomping along
On this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

[Chorus]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Verse 2]
Cold winter bleeds
On the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

[Chorus]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes

(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

[Outro]
It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

[Chorus, one more time]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Thru these architect's eyes


We Prick You

[Verse 1]
White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Verse 2]
Mama can I kiss you daddy can I **** you  (tell)
(We wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Want to be screwing
When the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Want to come quick and die

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Verse 3]
All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
(Even if you disagree)

[Chorus]
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

[Outro]
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree)
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well


Segue - Nathan Adler

[Spoken]
Old Touchschriek was the main name server suspected of being a shoulder surfer. But he didn't know from shit about challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling interest drugs. She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was, if you don't mind me saying so, an update demon. Now Leon he couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight... He jumps up on the stage with a criss criss machete and slashes around cutting a zero on everything. I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself: "Whoa! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began


I Am With Name

[Verse 1]
I was
Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own

I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are

Strangers When We Meet

[Intro]
You
You
You

You
You
You

[Verse 1]
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 2]
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[Chorus 2]
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 3]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

[Chorus 3]
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful, that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, but we're strangers when we meet

[Outro]
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

A Small Plot of Land

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Verse 2]
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

[Verse 3]
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes

Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Poor dunce, poor dunce

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

[Outro]
People spat upon him
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul


The Hearts Filthy Lesson

[Intro]
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson

[Verse]
There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, Ramona
If there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

[Interlude]
Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

[Chorus]
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson

[Post-Chorus]
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

[Interlude]
Paddy? Paddy?

[Bridge]
Paddy, will you carry me?
I think I've lost my way
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already five years older, I'm already in my grave
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy
I think I've lost my way

[Outro]
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic decade
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others


Wishful Beginnings

[Verse 1]
Cruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl

[Verse 2]
Please hide
For the pain must feel
Like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl

[Verse 3]
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

[Verse 4]
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
Wishful beginnings
But we lived
Unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl

[Outro]
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you...


Hallo Spaceboy

[Verse]
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free, don't you want to be free?

Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me

[Chorus]
So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

[Verse]
(Hallo) Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
And that chaos is killing me

[Chorus]
So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me
(Will cover you)
Bye bye love

[Outro]
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Good time love
Be sweet sweet dove
Bye bye spaceboy
Bye bye love
Moondust will cover you


Segue - Algeria Touchshriek

[Spoken]
My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and
Empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here
Still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone
Or that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that


The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (As Beauty)

Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake
And stare the sun
'Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers
Brutal vermin

I shake
And stare
At the watery moon

With the same desire
As the sober philistine

Turn and turn again

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction
As beauty
I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake

I shake
I shake

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day

Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day

Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day

The Motel

[Verse 1]
For we're living
In a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

[Verse 2]
It's a kind of living which recognises
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

[Chorus]
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

[Verse 3]
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

[Chorus]
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

[Verse 4]
And the silence flies
On its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

[Chorus Variation]
And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you


No Control

[Verse 1]
Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 2]
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkest shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control
The web we weave
My life will be lost in falling leaves

[Verse 3]
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 4]
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

[Bridge]
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

[Verse 5]
Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burn his tracks, his bloody robes

[Verse 6]
You've got to have a scheme
You've got to have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged

[Outro]
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged


Outside

[Refrain]
Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
It happens today

[Verse 1]
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you

[Refrain]
Now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now

[Verse 2]
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside

[Chorus]
It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening

[Refrain]
Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

[Chorus]
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
The music is outside

[Outro]
Outside
Outside
Outside


I'm Deranged

[Verse 1]
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe
If I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return, no return
I'm deranged
Deranged, down, down, down
I'm deranged, down, down, down
So cruise me, babe; cruise me, baby

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me; cruise me; cruise me, babe

[Verse 2]
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe

[Outro]
I'm deranged


I Have Not Been to Oxford Town

[Verse 1]
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Verse 2]
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here) (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

[Verse 3]
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the Twentieth Century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th Century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
