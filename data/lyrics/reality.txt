Pablo Picasso

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

[Verse 1]
Well some people try to pick up girls
They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
The girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
He could walk down your street
Girls could not resist his stare
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Not like you
Wow!

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

[Verse 2]
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Well the girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
Well he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Wow!

[Chorus]
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails


Try Some, Buy Some

[Verse 1]
Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you

[Chorus]
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Untill I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

[Verse 2]
Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

[Chorus]
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Untill I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

[Outro]
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh


Days

[Verse 1]
Cash girls suffer me, I’ve got no enemies
I’m walking down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 1]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths come
Now and then
Can’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Verse 2]
Dollar days, survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
I’m falling down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 2]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
It’s all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I’m falling down
Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Outro]
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to


New Killer Star

[Verse 1]
See the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
(We'll discover a star)
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

[Refrain]
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

[Pre-Chorus]
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

[Chorus]
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

[Verse 2]
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
(We'll discover a star)
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

[Refrain]
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

[Pre-Chorus]
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

[Chorus]
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
Oooh oo
I got a better way
Ready, set, go


She'll Drive the Big Car

[Verse 1]
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along Riverside

[Verse 2]
She slips beneath the sheets
A husband's quiet devoted wife
But strangers, sad and nervous
By the dawn's early light
Love lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on Riverside

[Chorus]
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson yeah
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there)

[Verse 3]
Way back when millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside

[Chorus]
She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now/I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now


Reality

[Verse 1]
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear

[Chorus]
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo

[Verse 2]
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo

[Chorus]
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

[Bridge]
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh


Looking for Water

[Verse 1]
Silver leaves are spinning round
Take my hand as we go down and down and down
Looking for water
But I lost God in a New York minute
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it
(Looking looking looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking looking looking)
I can't breathe the air
Can't raise the fight
Because all we've got left is a beat in the night
And I'm
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking

[Verse 2]
Take my hand as we go down and down
Leave it all behind nothing will be found
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)

I can't live in this cage
I can't eat this candy
To the ends of the Earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever

[Bridge]
(Looking looking)
(Looking looking)

[Outro]
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)
I'm looking for water
Looking for water


Bring Me The Disco King

[Verse 1]
You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

[Refrain]
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

[Verse 2]
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

[Refrain]
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

[Pre-Chorus]
We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

[Chorus]
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

[Verse 3]
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

[Chorus]
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king


Never Get Old

[Verse 1]
Better take care
Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown
3-2-1

[Pre-Chorus]
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now

[Chorus]
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old

[Verse 2]
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
Want to be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

[Chorus]
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get old
I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever get old


The Loneliest Guy

[Verse 1]
Streets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive

[Refrain]
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

[Verse 2]
Steam under floor
Shards by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now

[Refrain]
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

[Bridge]
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh

[Refrain]
Well I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world

[Outro]
Not me
Not me


Fall Dog Bombs The Moon

[Verse 1]
Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog

[Verse 2]
I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog

[Chorus]
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Full dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Full dog bombs the moon
What a dog

[Verse 3]
There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

[Verse 4]
These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

[Chorus]
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Full dog bombs the moon
A devil in the market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Full dog bombs the moon
What a dog
