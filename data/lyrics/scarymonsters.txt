Up the Hill Backwards

[Verse 1]
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer

[Chorus]
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

[Verse 2]
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling, witnesses falling

[Chorus 1]
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, up the hill backwards
It'll be alright, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
While we sleep, they go to work
We're legally crippled, it's the death of love

[Chorus]
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

[Bridge]
More idols than realities, ooh-ooh
I'm OK, you're so-so, ooh-ooh

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, up the hill backwards
It'll be alright, ooh-ooh

[Instrumental Outro]


Ashes to Ashes

[Verse 1]
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Verse 2]
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Outro]
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom


Scream Like a Baby

[Verse 1]
Well, I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam
'Cause he was like me

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Verse 2]
Well, they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And, oh, I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of societ... societ... s...

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Bridge]
No athletic program
No discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat
Swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

[Chorus]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

[Outro]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun


Because You're Young

[Verse 1]
Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
She can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)

[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

[Verse 2]
He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

[Pre-Chorus]
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)
These pieces are broken (like I say)
These pieces are broken (hope I'm wrong but I know)

[Chorus]
Because you're young
You'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young
What could be nicer for you
And it'll make me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

[Outro]
A million dreams
A million scars
A million


Teenage Wildlife

[Verse 1]
Well, how come you only want tomorrow?
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms
Strength in your stride and hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

[Verse 2]
So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And you push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul, are you one of the New Wave boys?

[Verse 3]
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall I do? They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

[Bridge]
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

[Verse 4]
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No, no

[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

[Verse 5]
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past
Who'll whisper low I miss you he really had to go
Well, each to his own, he was another piece of teenage wildlife
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild... life

[Outro]
Wild...
Wild... life


Fashion

[Verse 1]
There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Ooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

[Verse 2]
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear
That people from good homes are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Outro]
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la


Kingdom Come

[Verse 1]
Well, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Oh Lord, I just need one day

[Chorus]
Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

[Verse 2]
Well, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

[Chorus]
Been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

[Bridge]
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm going to die

[Chorus]
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
Who will pardon me?
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)

[Outro]
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
