Station to Station

[Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

Golden Years

[Refrain]
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 2]
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 3]
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Bridge]
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

Word on a Wing

[Verse 1]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced a way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in Heaven or Hell

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Verse 2]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see
I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

[Bridge]
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh...

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
But it's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?


Stay

[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too


Wild Is the Wind

[Verse 1]
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Verse 2]
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me

[Verse 3]
Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Chorus]
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me

[Verse 3]
Don't you know you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[Outro]
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
