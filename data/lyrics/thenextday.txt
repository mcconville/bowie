Love Is Lost

[Verse 1]
It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

[Verse 2]
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

[Verse 3]
Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love

You know so much, it’s making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?

Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?


How Does the Grass Grow?

[Verse 1]
There's a graveyard by the station where the girls
Wear vinyl skirts and sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1s upon the little hills
Such sadness and grief, the kids die standing
That's where we made our tryst and struggled with our guns
Would you still love me if the clocks could go backwards?
The girls would fill with blood, and the grass will be green again
Remember the dead, they were so great, some of them

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

[Verse 2]
Well I lived a blind life, a white face, a prison
That you made, a life out of nothing, now I ride by
Black roads. I miss you more than you'll never, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes and my stone heart

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

[Bridge]
I gaze in defeat at the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you'll sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood


Boss of Me

[Verse 1]
Tell me when you're sad
I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?

[Verse 2]
You fly through the night
With tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

[Pre-Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?

[Bridge]
You looked at me and you weeped for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

[Pre-Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?

[Break]

[Chorus]
Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?


Where Are We Now?

[Verse 1]
Had to get the train
From Potsdamer platz
You never knew that
That I could do that
Just walking the dead
Sitting in the Dschungel
On Nürnberger Strasse
A man lost in time near KaDeWe
Just walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Twenty thousand people
Cross Bösebrücke
Fingers are crossed
Just in case
Walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know

[Outro]
As long as there's sun
As long as there's sun
As long as there's rain
As long as there's rain
As long as there's fire
As long as there's fire
As long as there's me
As long as there's you


Dancing Out in Space

[Verse 1]
Cutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight

[Chorus]
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)

[Verse 2]
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You’ve got stars upon your head
You’ve got my name and number
You've got to take the floor

[Chorus]
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space

(You Will) Set the World on Fire

[Verse 1]
Midnight in the Village
Seeger lights the candles
From Bitter End to Gaslight
Baez leaves the stage
Ochs takes notes
When the black girl and guitar
Burn together hot in rage
You've got what it takes
You say too much

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

[Verse 2]
Kennedy would kill for the lines that you’ve written
Van Ronk says to Bobby "she’s the next real thing"
Crouched in the half light, screaming like a banshee
You’re in the boat babe, we're in the water
You say too much

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire


Dirty Boys

[Verse 1]
Something like tobacco road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley fair

[Verse 2]
I will buy you feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with dirty boys

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

[Verse 3]
We all gone mad
We all want you
Vinny and the boys, we all go through
You got to learn to hold your tongue
This ain't the moon this is burnin' sun

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys


The Next Day

[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes he tells her
I'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye, yeah
All that day she thinks of his love, yeah
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

[Verse 2]
Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

[Chorus]
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

[Verse 3]
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

[Chorus]
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

[Outro]
Listen


I'd Rather Be High

[Verse 1]
Nabokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Grunewald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Verse 2]
The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City’s full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Bridge]
I’m seventeen my looks can prove it
I’m so afraid that I will lose it
I’d rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex
Yeah

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on the men in the sand
I’d rather be high


Heat

[Verse 1]
When we saw Mishima's dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow

[Chorus]
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

[Verse 2]
I can only love you by hating him more
That's not the truth, it's too big a word
He believed that love is theft
Love and war, the theft of love

[Chorus]
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

[Bridge]
But I am a seer, I am a liar
I am a seer, but I am a liar

[Chorus]
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison


If You Can See Me

If you can see me I can see you

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

Just chutes and ladders
And this is the kiss
American anna fantasticalsation
From nowhere to nothing
And neither way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the light
The beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East

Now you can say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
My love of violence and tenants' sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you

I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beast, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, drizzle of dark ashes
I will slaughter your kind, descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, the lord of theft
Burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me


Valentine's Day

[Verse 1]
Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star

[Chorus]
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Verse 2]
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall

[Chorus]
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Outro]
(Yeah)
Valentine Valentine
(Yeah) (Woo) (Woo)
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hands
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine


You Feel So Lonely You Could Die

[Verse 1]
No one ever saw you moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends, stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

[Chorus 1]
Some night on the thriller’s street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin's needle on a crowded train
I bet you feel so lonely you could die

[Verse 2]
Buildings crammed with people, landscapes filled with wrath
Gray concrete city, rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly before you close the door
A room of bloody history, you made sure of that

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam
I could read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh, please, please make it soon

[Chorus 2]
Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues, my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end
Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely you could die
Feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could die
