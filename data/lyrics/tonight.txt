Tumble and Twirl

[Verse 1]
I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter

[Chorus 1]
(We'll meet in borneo)
I'll reply with a broken spear
(We are *unclear*)
That dusky mulatto
(We'll meet in borneo)
In nylons and tattoos
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
We dance in the sand
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)

[Verse 2]
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
(Stereo)
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
(Borneo)
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes
Way down yonder in Borneo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle

[Chorus 2]
(We'll meet in borneo)
They laugh and they mumble
(We are *unclear*)
Enjoying the show
(We'll meet in borneo)
And that dusky mulatto
(I like the free world)
Hot juice in coke bottles
(We'll meet in borneo)
In blue jeans and tattoos
(We are *unclear*)
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(Tumble and twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
(Tumble and twirl)

[Chorus 3/Outro]
I like the free world
(I like the free word)
They say it's pretty
(tumble and twirl)
This time of year
(I like the free word)
They tumble and twirl
(tumble and twirl)
I'll tumble and twirl

Don't Look Down

[Verse 1]
Don't look down
They're making sort of crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 2]
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 3]
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

[Verse 4]
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

[Chorus]
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no


I Keep Forgetting

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more

[Verse 1]
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said

[Verse 2]
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more

[Verse 3]
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more


God Only Knows

[Verse 1]
If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
I may not always love you
But as long as there are
Stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you


Loving the Alien

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Chorus 2]
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you’ll believe you’re loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Outro]


Dancing with the Big Boys

[Verse 1]
Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers
And stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word
And you're out of sync
Talking 'bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)

[Verse 2]
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad
They weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)

[Verse 3]
There are too many people
Too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's
Trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)

[Verse 4]
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This can be embarrassing
(Big boys)
Dancing with the big boys
(Dancing with the big boys)

La-la-la, la-la-la...
(Big boys)


Neighborhood Threat

[Verse 1]
Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures

[Chorus]
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

[Verse 2]
You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting

[Chorus]
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you


Blue Jean

[Verse 1]
Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)

[Verse 2]
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Oh, Blue Jean, look out world, oh you know I've got mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She got Latin roots
She got everything

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can tempt me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody sent me
(Oh, somebody send me)

{Hook}

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can tempt me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody sent me
(Oh, somebody send me)

Somebody, somebody
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)


Tonight

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 1]
We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
The stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 3]
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Bridge]
And they know just we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight

[Verse 4]
Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Outro]
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
But the stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
