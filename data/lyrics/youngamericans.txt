Fascination

[Intro]
I've got to use her

[Verse 1]
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what she put me through, dear
Fascination moves, sweeping near me
Still, I take ya

[Chorus]
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(Can a heartbeat) can a heartbeat

[Verse 2]
Your soul is calling like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think that I'm a little crazy
Ooh, but pleasure seeks this thing, I think I like fascination
Still, I take ya

[Chorus]
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on

Somebody Up There Likes Me

[Verse 1]
He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"

[Chorus 1]
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

[Verse 2]
He's the savage son of the TV tube, planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around, predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he had the plan, he had to use

[Pre-Chorus]
(Somebody) he's so divine, (ooh, ooh) his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight (somebody up there)
(Somebody) his ever loving face (ooh, ooh)
Smiles on the whole human race
(Somebody, somebody, somebody up there)

[Chorus]
(Somebody) he's got his eye on your soul
(Ooh, ooh) and his hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)

[Bridge]
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you've pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been

[Chorus]
Keep your eye on your soul and your hand on your heart
He says "don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)

[Verse 3]
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell?
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino? Could he sell you anything?
(Somebody, somebody)

[Chorus]
Keep your eye on your soul, keep your hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

[Outro]
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
(Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie
Soul shine (ooh-ooh), so divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh), so divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)
(Somebody)
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Yeah, can't remember peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Soul shines (somebody)
Soul shines, so divine, somebody (somebody)
Soul shines, so divine, somebody (somebody)


Can You Hear Me

[Verse 1]
Once we were lovers
Can they understand?
Closer than others I was your
I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches
Ooh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day
To see if I'm faking it all

[Chorus]
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

[Verse 2]
There's been many others
(Oo-oo-oo-ooh) so many times
Sixty new cities, and what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly
I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

[Chorus]
Well, can you (hear me?)
Can you (feel me inside?)
Show your (love, love)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

[Chorus]
Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love (love, love)
Show me your sweet, sweet love, show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right
To your love life, baby

[Outro]
Take it in right to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right
Right to your love life
Take it in right, ah
(Why don't you take it?) take it in, take it in right
(Why don't you take it?) Right down, right down
(Why don't you take it?) mmm, why don't you take it?

(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Right to your heart) take it down, take it down

(Why don't you take it?)
(Why don't you take it?) take it in right
(Right to your heart)


Across the Universe

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on across the universe

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro]
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Hey, nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing going to change it
Nothing going to change it
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
Nothing's going to change my world


Young Americans

[Verse 1]
They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Verse 2]
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
But she wants the young American

[Bridge]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

[Chorus]
All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?

Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

[Chorus]
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

[Verse 4]
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

[Chorus]
All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American
(I want the young American)
All right
I want the young American, young American

[Outro]
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All I want is the young American
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)


Win

[Intro]
(Hey, it ain't over)

[Verse 1]
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ooh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh, it ain't over)

[Verse 2]
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) It ain't over

[Chorus]
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) All you got to do is win (it ain't over, no)

[Outro]
And your smile is spreading thin (Ooh, seek and believe in you)
It seems you're trying not to lose (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin (Ooh, that's all you got to do)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no)
(Ooh, seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Woo-hoo! (Ooh) All you've got (that's all you've got to do)
Is all you've got (Ooh, it ain't over)
It ain't over
