It Ain't Easy

[Verse 1]
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 2]
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down


Five Years

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years


Hang On to Yourself

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah


Star

[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well, he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Chorus 2]
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus 1]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
Get it on, yeah

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

[Outro]
Rock & roll star
Rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)


Lady Stardust

[Verse 1]
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
Yes, he was awful nice
Really quite outta sight
And he sang all night long

[Verse 2]
Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise, and he sang
All night, all night long

[Bridge]
Ooh, how I sighed
When they asked if I knew his name

[Chorus]
Oh, it was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang
All night long

(Get some pussy now)


Rock 'n' Roll Suicide

[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

[Bridge]
Oh no, love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!

[Outro]
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands


Starman

[Intro]
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Chorus]
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Outro]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la


Ziggy Stardust

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our bones?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was The Nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar


Soul Love

[Verse 1]
Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Outro]


Moonage Daydream

[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
(Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe)
('Lectric eye on me babe)
Put your ray gun to my head
(Put your ray gun to my head)
(Ray gun to my head)
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
(Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah)
(Freak out in a moonage daydream
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...)

[Outro]
Freak out (Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out...)
Far out (Far out, far out, far out, far out...)
In out (In out, in out, in out, in out...)


Suffragette City

[Verse 1]
(Hey man) Oh, leave me alone, you know
(Hey man) Oh, Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) My schooldays insane
(Hey man) My work's down the drain
(Hey man) Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) Oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) Dear droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
And don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Whoa, Suffragette city
Ooh, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette
Oh, wham, bam, thank you, Ma'am!
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City
Ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!
